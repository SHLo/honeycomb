# Project Honeycomb
##### Created by Jacob Estep, Shih-Hsin Lo, Saif Mustafa, and Abhijeet Saraf


Honeycomb is an app created for a project by graduate students at University of Washington's GIX
Our app was designed to assist Mary's Place Seattle's Outreach and Diversion team in collecting resource information, identifying resources nearby, and sharing this info with the families they help.
