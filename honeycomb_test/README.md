Before building:
Make sure to get the AndroidManifext.xml, secrets.dart, and AppDelegate.swift files from the "sensitive dev files" folder on our shared drive
make sure you have the repo cloned to your computer
copy the xml to honeycomb/honeycomb_test/android/app/src/main
copy secrets.dart into honeycomb/honeycomb_test/lib
copy the swift to honeycomb/honeycomb_test/ios/Runner
these are kept off the github because they contain api keys
